The Unknown Terror (1957) - full transcript,"The mysterious disappearance of Jim Wheatley (Charles Gray), while exploring a cave near a Mexican village, brings his sister, Gina (Mala Powers), and her husband, Dan Matthews (John Howard), to the territory to search for him. Embittered, crippled Pete Morgan (Paul Richards), insists on going along and reminds Dan that his condition is Dan's fault since it happened in an accident in which Pete saved Dan's life. Plus, Gina was Pete's sweetheart before the accident. Did we mention embittered? The party hears about an old Indian legend concerning the Cave of the Dead where human sacrifices were made to the Gods. Dr. Ramsey (Gerald Milton), married to a native girl, Concha (May Wynn), claims no knowledge of the cave, but he is here because the climate is ideal for rapid fungus growth for his work on cultivating fungus for antibiotics. You don't have to be from France to know that if the climate is good for fungus growth, a cave is even better but it takes Dan and Pete a while to get around to that.","(intense orchestral music),(Jim screaming),(dark foreboding music),(water burbling),About six months ago,,Jim Wheatley went south,of the American continent,to search for a cave,known as Cueva Muerte,,the Cave of the Dead.,He didn't return.,We're recalling this story,because today there was a new development,

Okul tirasi (2021) - full transcript,"Yusuf and his best friend Memo are pupils at a boarding school for Kurdish boys, secluded in the mountains of Eastern Anatolia. When Memo falls mysteriously ill, Yusuf is forced to struggle through the bureaucratic obstacles put up by the school's repressive authorities to try to help his friend. But by the time the adults in charge finally understand the seriousness of Memo's condition and try to get him to the hospital, the school has been buried under a sudden, heavy snowfall.

Le Gitan (1975) - full transcript,"Hugo Sennart is a French Gypsy, wanted by the police for theft. The same inspector who's searching for him is also looking for a jewel thief, Yan Kuq, whose wife has died under suspicious circumstance just after a major burglary. The Gypsy needs to settle a few scores and make one more heist before going to ground, and, by coincidence, his path takes him close to Yan, who's hiding in the hotel of a close friend and former lover, Ninie. The Gypsy lives by a code of honor, which puts him at risk on occasion; and he despises those who treat his people as worse than dogs. The police close in. Is there honor among thieves?","BASED ON THE NOVEL,""HISTOIRE DE FOU"" BY JOSÉ GIOVANNI,Are you the Sennarts?,Excuse me.,Mr. Sennart?,Yes?,We're looking for your son, Hugo.,We know he came back.,He never left.,So where is he?,In here.,If you're helping him,,you'll pay the price. You know that?,

,There were a lot of them.,I think they're scared.,{\an8}Hugo Sennart, also known as the Gypsy.,{\an8}The Belgians just missed him,,but they missed him all the same.,Sentenced in France three years ago,to a lifetime of forced labor,for the murder of the mayor,of a village that evicted them.,He escaped from the power station in Melun,together with Jo Amila,,also known as Jo the Boxer,,{\an8}sentenced to 20 years,after an attempted bank robbery.,{\an8}His accomplice, Jacques Helman.,Also sentenced to 20 years,for the same case.,Dear little Helman doesn't have,a nickname.,They've been on the run for two years now,

,
,and their track record has earned us,a summons to the Chamber of Deputies,and no fewer than four arguments,from the Minister himself.,They're out there in the open,like men who have nothing to lose.,{\an8}Look at those eyes.,There's more than just hatred in them.,There's contempt, a deep disgust,that comes from his race.,He said so at the trial.,Those gypsies are destined for the dock,before they're even born.,And besides,,society tolerates them,only in a vacant lot,or on the edge of a dump.,They're practically animals,with the plague.,This lone wolf steals to feed his pack.,His motivations reinforce his violence.,Jacques, get the lights.,It's up to you, Special Brigades,,to arrest this man,,who you can be sure doesn't sleep,in the same bed twice.,I know that gypsy hunting,is in style right now.,In order to evacuate their camps,in Arcueil, Ivry and elsewhere,,all police forces are being mobilized.,They should concentrate,on the banks and main rail stations.,That's all up to me, of course.,On that note, you're dismissed.,For the time being, we have the five,,the seven, the ten and the thirteen…,A masterpiece.,This one won't be easy to sell.,Jealous? But jealous of what, honey?,He's 35 years older than me.,You're the only one that matters.,Everything I take from him is for you.,No, I won't know until he leaves.,No, he doesn't suspect anything,,but it's secret on principle.,You're so silly!,Still suffering from that pesky migraine?,Stop it or I'll jump!,Have you gone completely insane?,Get back!,If I jump, everyone will think,that you pushed me.,And you'll get life!,Because my lover… He's a cop,,if you really want to know.,Get down.,During the night, a jeweler was robbed.,At dawn, Yan Kuq's wife fell,from their penthouse window.,If Yan weren't a notorious safebreaker,,there would surely be,no relation between the two cases.,Questions?,An ex-safebreaker?,He's not getting any younger.,You can't put an age on an expert.,Find him. I want to know,where he spent the night.,With his wife.,It's not like she can say otherwise.,Check his schedule. Follow him.,Let's get the brigade on the case.,They're already mobilized,against the Gypsy and his gang.,And what have they achieved?,Six attacks in two weeks.,No, you deal with Yan.,I'll keep trying,to get the minister off our backs.,Well, that sounds promising.,Jacques, I'm counting on you.,Don't you agree, Mr. Mareuil?,Yes, of course. It's just…,Are we going to start digging around,in that woman's life?,Crisis of conscience?,Well, this isn't the place for that.,Let me explain it again.,One incident at a jeweler's,,another at Yan's home.,It's a possibility that the latter,is connected to the former.,I don't know why, there's just…,It's like a trace of perfume.,Go and take a whiff at Yan's club.,That's just it, Chief.,I can't go down there.,-Why not?,-Because…,Well…,-They know me down there.,-So they'll see you again, that's all.,Do you remember when you thought,Yan was selling the Gypsy's junk,through Jo Amila?,I followed Yan for two weeks.,And that's when…,-That's when I…,-When you what?,Well, basically, I met his wife.,I had no choice! She was always there,at the cash register.,-That's no reason to get upset.,-Yeah…,But she was so beautiful. And her body…,I slept with her.,You'd have done the same in my place.,That's not very professional.,I thought she'd turn him in,sooner or later.,She was sick of him.,Basically, you were on duty.,That's it, Chief. Especially since,she called me right before she died.,She called you?,She was jealous. She'd call me,at all hours of the night.,It was four o'clock in the morning.,I was alone.,Alone?,And then suddenly she hung up.,Yes. Yan had just gotten home.,Unfortunately, your testimony is useless.,Why?,Can you see yourself in court explaining,how you were the lover,of a gangster's wife?,So what? It's a modern method.,""So what, it's a modern method""?,You'll still have journalists and lawyers,saying that you're the one who killed her,because the situation,got too compromising.,That's not true, I swear!,Do you know what a cop's word,is worth these days?,All right.,You can finish,what you so diligently started.,I don't want to hear any more talk,of Yan. I want him right here.,Roger? It's Blot.,About the Gypsy…,Couldn't we do a series of raids,in the area?,Yes, of course I know he's not there, but,it could help turn them against him.,You see?,Conflict always pays off.,This is the last straw.,I'm hiding out in Trouville,,in my pajamas, watching the regattas,and what do we get?,An army of cops!,From all over France and beyond!,At my house.,This Gypsy is worse than the plague.,No need to exaggerate.,The cops won't be here long,and there's no reason for them,to come knocking.,Jeannot, your obliviousness,is astounding. I'm out of here.,Is the villa in your brother's name?,-Yes.,-So what about your brother?,He's got a criminal record,that's sure to drag us down with him.,The cops are going to search this town,with a fine-tooth comb.,This is the first place,they'll think to look.,They're going to turn,your brother's house upside down.,You're leaving? But your lawyer,will be here in an hour.,I'll see him later.,I'm tired of telling him,that I didn't kill my wife,and hearing him tell me that everything,will work out once I turn myself in.,Maybe he's got something new.,He can tell me in Palavas-les-Flots.,You can't travel across France!,I'm going sardine fishing,at Gullible Pierrot's.,You'll be stopped,at the first police roadblock.,At my age?,Have you seen me?,Put those photos down.,They're blocking the view.,There's a guy on that boat,playing cup-and-ball.,The one in front's for you.,Take a look.,Oh, boy… Fascinating!,That's fabulous.,I don't see what's so fabulous.,Well, you're never interested in anyone.,Suits or chicks.,Sometimes I wonder why you even escaped.,We dream of what we don't have.,And when we have it…,We'd be better off abroad.,I'm already abroad.,In prison, you told me how,sometimes you feel like yelling.,At whom? At what?,You wouldn't understand.,You can't change anything alone.,It all depends on other people.,You can't change other people, either.,So sometimes when you're in pain,,you want to yell.,Can you imagine the din,if everyone who needed to,started yelling, all at once?,We call that a revolution.,I don't. A revolution is a war.,I'm thinking of something else.,Something else?,You wouldn't be able…,I'm going to take a walk.,He's complicated, right?,Sure.,He doesn't even think about women.,He's got nothing,but vengeance in his balls.,He thinks too much. Look at the Boxer.,When he thinks, it's chaos!,Now I understand why,you didn't make a career out of it.,Hey, Marcel!,Double the good news.,-Isn't the Gypsy around?,-We'll tell him, don't worry.,He'll do whatever we want.,Exactly.,Fine.,First of all, I found Riquet the Parisian.,Second of all,,the Nice case is set for July 8.,We'll start with Nice.,No.,We'll start with Riquet.,-Where is the bastard?,-In a little hotel in Palavas-les-Flots.,A spot called Bob's.,That's very interesting and all,,but we'd prefer the Nice job.,Money first.,That's the last case,,then Jacques and I will cross the border.,We're going to Palavas.,We're not your stooges.,I know what you are.,Hold on, now. Who put you,in charge of business?,You, unless you want to end up,back in jail.,It's not like your pals from Pigalle,or wherever came looking for you!,Without me and my brothers,,you'd still be in there. So Palavas first!,What do we do?,Screw that.,Leave it.,Beat it, Jacques.,BOB'S,Is he alone?,Yes.,Riquet! Open up. It's me, Bob.,What's going on?,We were in prison together.,Didn't he tell you?,In your neck of the woods.,I only accepted the position,to be of service to you, right?,You don't remember me, then.,Let's go out.,That should refresh your memory.,The tourists are starting to arrive.,Bob's is always a little crowded.,I've heard the waitresses,go upstairs with the patrons.,Sometimes that's a big help.,Remember when we always,used to go to Ninie's?,She ran her bar like a boss.,We all had a crush on her.,She was 20 years old.,Life just passes you by.,I'll have these scars forever.,Here too!,Well, it wasn't just me, was it?,That's true. The guards held me down.,That's what they're paid for.,But you…,You said something as you attacked me.,Remind me what you said.,You know, it was just…,Go on. Say it.,""Gypsy scum""?,You know, we all say things that…,""Woodlouse""?,""Vermin""?,""Race of whores."",""Son of a bitch and a pig."",Remember that one?,Gypsy?,You're not going to do that, are you?,You have to admit that it's much better,here than in prison.,You wouldn't have been in prison long.,Afterwards you would've had,far more freedom.,My basic principle is that one hour,in jail is an hour too long.,The police handed the entire file,to the judge. I saw him. He's a young'un.,I told him that you call me,from time to time. That amused him.,Of course, he reissued the warrant,for your arrest and had the apartment,and the club sealed.,What a charming young man.,All right, here's my version of events.,I spent the night at home,in the conjugal bed. I got up early.,I wanted to walk,the empty streets of Paris,with the night-shift workers.,It keeps me honest.,And poetic!,I'll give you that.,My wife didn't believe me, obviously.,A woman in love…,She wanted to come with me.,In love and an early bird.,I refused and said,I wouldn't discuss it further. Anyway…,That's the scene set.,Everyone knows the principle.,It's like she went crazy, threatening,to throw herself off the balcony.,In any case, it's very simple.,But that's not how a woman,with a lover would behave.,A lover?,Is that in the file?,No.,Because this lover of hers,is a criminal police inspector.,-How do you know that?,-Your barman.,He heard some officers talking about it.,It seems this guy's name is Mareuil.,Right.,I'd like this Mareuil to say it,to my face.,Of course,,he'll never speak out officially.,But unofficially, the police are,using it to form an opinion.,You can't convict someone,on the basis of unofficial information.,Think again.,Come and tell the judge,your final version.,Never.,Hey!,There's an army of cops coming in,from all over, even Paris.,They're not here for you.,Last night they found a corpse at,the edge of a pond five kilometers away,,riddled with bullets.,It's the Gypsy and his cronies,picking up a guy on the run,hiding out at Bob's.,I can't believe it.

Now that he's dead,,no one knows him.,So you don't know anything about,the guy driving the car, either?,I spend most of my time at sea,or in the harbor.,Try to understand.,Someone tipped the Gypsy off,about Riquet being at Bob's.,Wouldn't that person know,where the Gypsy is?,That's smart thinking, Chief.,I won't drop this bone easily.,I've got half a mind,to send the tax inspectors after you.,I'd love to know,where you found the money,for your boat and all the rest.,So get that brain into gear.,I'll be back to see you.,By the way, I love grilled sardines.,Sure, it's perfectly safe here.,Goddamn cops!,Can't that Gypsy go and be,an asshole over the border?,The gudgeon seems to be far less,popular than the sardine this year.,I'm going to try my luck,on the banks of the Marne.,Ninie has an inn near Champigny.,Police! Identity check!,Police! Identity check!,Police! Identity check!,But Chief, you know who we are!,Come on, now.,-These are orders from Paris.,-We're looking for the Gypsy.,That's no reason to stop me from working!,You can look all you want,,you won't find anything.,We'll sure remember this club!,It's a disgrace!,All I want is news of the Gypsy.,I am not an intelligence agency.,Well, I advise that you become one.,The problem with your bike,is that you can't wear a suit.,To get up north,,we've got new license plates.,We've got papers.,Italian diplomatic corps.,It'll be a Lancia.,They can take them.,I prefer my bike.

enjoy it here,,you will see.,And you'll be able to spend,a lot of time with Julia.,Diego would have loved this.,Let's go inside, it's very cold,,right?,This was the street with,all the stores, do you remember?,I was less than ten years old,when we left.,How can I remember!,The bar, to call it that,,is in the rice fields.,There used to be more,,but you see,,things are getting worse.,Well, this is the headquarters.,It´s a bit of a mess,,but you know, a man alone...,This big table is mine.,Now that you are here,,you can use it.,Up to you.,Well, shall we go to the field?,And that shotgun?,My third arm,,I always carry it with me.,Eusebio.,Mrs. Francisca.,Hello, Ricardo.,I am Francisca Romero.,I´m here to welcome you.,You have to be grateful,with the people who come to help.,And besides, you are from the area,,but I don't know you.,My father was Rodrigo Gracia.,We left when I was a child.,I don't know if you...,This head,only remembers what it wants.,I am sure it will be very good,to have you here.,They are,in a very delicate situation.,Hopefully we can remedy it,before it's too late.,Yes.,We live in a wonderful land,,Ricardo.,We hardly go without anything,,except work.,and now, the water, of course.,These people live off the land,and these last few years have been,a real disaster for them.,Yes, I studied the area well.,So the idea is,to draw up a plan to preserve,'Laguna

responsibility.,Their source of life.,Yes, I feed them,and they depend on me.,Their source of life, yes.,I am sure you will understand,what my priorities are.,Or theirs, it´s all the same.,I know that you risk joining,the wetlands expert science committee,depending on the success,of this project.,But don't lose sight of,the seriousness around you,,that was also yours.,You can't give up your roots,,and much less reject them.,I do not reject anything.,That is precisely why I am here,,to defend this place.,Good.,Defending this place,also means defending your people.,I won´t keep you anymore,,you probably have a lot to do.,You have a good recruit.,Trust him, he is a good man.,I hope you are comfortable,in your new house.,It is the best of my properties.,Say hello to your wife,and

end of ""Laguna Blanca"".,All of this by the Moors,,that they were very clever.,It's been so many years,and here it remains.,The general one supplies,the other three.,That's right.,That one was built later,,it is the one that controls,total flow in case of emergency.,Squacco herons, native.,22,000 hectares to live.,They can´t complain, no.,Eusebio,,I thought that the house,was provided by the Reserve.,Mrs. Francisca has yielded it,to the corporation, but it's hers.,I don't know if I want to live there,with my family.,I don't want to be in debt with her.,She knows things about me,and I don't know how,or why she told me,,but few people know.,She has contacts everywhere.,She cares about her business,She has had everything organized,for years.,and buys the whole harvest,from farmers in the area.,If they don't sell at the price,she sets, they don´t sell.,Indeed.,Sure, there are many Franciscas,around the world.,What happened,when they found out that the heron,started nesting here?,What did she do?,Well, then,she got into the ecologists,and the reserve was declared.,They created some laws,,some measures,,but no one really noticed.,Everybody did what they always do:,hunting, fishing, as usual.,The problem is,no matter,how much it is protected,that animal,is not going to feed anyone.,Here people live from the lagoon,,because water is needed,to irrigate the rice fields.,And when there is no more water?,Well, what can I say?,Here, day to day life is important,,to eat.,And don't think,every family gets to do it.,There is a lot of misery here,,Ricardo.,And

jealous.,I had a wife, you know?,She was stubborn...,She died young, very sudden.,People said that, in time,,I would get my life back, but... no.,Do you have children?,I have one, yes.,And I sent him very far away,,two years ago.,I don't want him to end up here,,and as a guard, like me.,Don't you like what you do?,I like to think,that my work is useful,to maintain the lagoon,as Isabel liked it, my

Mo ngai: To Kei Fung dik din ying sai gaai (2013) - full transcript,"As Hong Kong's foremost filmmaker, Johnnie To himself becomes the protagonist of this painstaking documentary exploring him and his boundless world of cinema. Shot over two years and featuring interviews with many of To's superstar collaborators, this candid and straightforward film follows the famed director in and out of studios, capturing his creative process and his reflections on the ever-changing state of entertainment and society.","Your right side.,Yes, okay.,Three, start rolling.,Cut!,Damn it. I can't go on.,Let's call it a day.,Seriously, think about,what you've been doing!,At first--,No! So was personnel recruiting.,You even messed up just finding people!,And you dare to talk back!,Look out!,You must be bloody blind.,

,One film crew can have,hundreds of vehicles.,I have no idea,what's the use of so many vehicles.,In Hong Kong, shooting,is supposed to be simple and clear.,You stay if you have things to do,,or you leave.,You are always fucking chatting.,Chatting with this guy, then with another.,And God knows what that guy is doing.,Get the hell out of here.,You are on the set,,so take care of the things on set.,Everything is fucking wrong.,How come?,Where is the watering pot?,Or just give me some water.,Let me do this. You're wearing gloves.,No, you take this.,I must admit, I do scold.,I won't deny it. What else could it be?,I did scold them.,That's what I do when I'm upset.,As a professional,,everyone should stick to their post.,Everyone should have,a professional attitude.,I believe that people who have worked,with me will understand,why I've scolded you,or why I've lost my temper.,For me to do that,,something must be wrong on the set.,-It's tipping over!,-Come on, one, two, three!,Okay, now it's right.,-One, two, three, push!,-Come on!,-One, two--,-It won't turn!,-Help Lin.,-Stop. Just let one man do the talking.,Come on. One, two, move!,-And the rest of you, just shut up.,-Yes, sir.,He doubted the current situation,of the mainland film industry,,or even particular films.,We would communicate.,Meanwhile, he didn't stand back,,he tried to enter this market.,I think he came here with a doubtful,and critical attitude.,Just push it over there in one go.,Have a rest.,-Ready!,-Let's go!,-Come on, guys!,-One, two, three!,-Come on!,-Use all your strength!,The geographic conditions posed,great difficulties in filming this one.,Not just the intense production schedule.,Also, the weather was challenging,and freezing.,After all, we are southerners.,We are not built,to resist the cold there.,There was also the problem,of altitude illness.,The most severe case,was over two dozen people,getting sick at the same time.,Actually, we had staff sent,to the hospital every day.,-He has altitude sickness.,-Call the doctor.,This won't do.,Cut! Do it again!,The car wasn't satisfying,,and neither were you.,Cough first, then go out, get it?,What does professional really mean?,If I call myself a professional director,,if I dare to make that statement,,it means I will get a movie done,no matter how hard it is.,Whatever happens,,a professional can't leave his post.,Almost all the staff,,including the sick ones,,didn't leave the crew.,We stood until the end together.,This is the spirit I see,in Milkyway Image.,Milkyway Image is not a center,for art films.,Milkyway Image is a tribute to cinema.,Apart from sticking to originality,,we have to survive first.,So we have to balance,,which doesn't mean,we would go against our principles,,or that we haven't tried our best,to create.,We can do any kind of films,,be it commercial or art.,Now I'll make my staff show you.,This flag sign means we need smoke.,Do you see that?,In the last couple of years,,both Ka-fai Wai and I,have done some work in mainland China.,We would discuss the issue,of entering the mainland market.,The conclusion was, why not try it out?,Certainly, co-productions have...,both advantages and disadvantages.,The advantage is that we can have,more subjects to choose from.,And the disadvantage is,,as many have mentioned,,that censorship is different,than in Hong Kong.,Co-productions have to adapt,to the censorship,and filming conditions in mainland China.,I think our films have hardly made,any progress in these years.,If we lose creative freedom,when making films,in a different environment,,we are no more than a tool.,I believe that only when our local culture,regains its strength,,will we have the chance of rebirth.,If all we want to do is make,co-productions with mainland China,,Hong Kong won't enjoy a good chance,to re-develop its culture.,I think a city without its own cinema,is quite pathetic.,Because cinema is part of a city's culture,I think the success of Lifeline,is owed to the Hong Kong film spirit.,It has many big scenes, however the budget,was only about six million HKD,,from which the basic expense,accounted for two or three million.,Taking off the wages for actors,,directors, and writers,,we were left with just over one million.,How can you shoot all these big scenes,with only one million?,I could hardly do that again now,,even just one scene. It's impossible.,At that time,,the whole crew were working very hard.,Everyone was doing extra jobs to help.,Think about it,,how could we use real fire?,Even I was startled at the scale of it.,Just see how I got blown up by that fire.,I'm really touched,after watching it again,,because it was due to the incredible,determination and boldness,of the whole crew.,The most endangered ones,were not the actors,,but the filming crew,,including the cameramen.,To produce a burning ceiling,with heavy fire, layer upon layer,,we needed to use a great deal of oil gas.,Once, we set a lot of oil gas,,but waited a long time before the ignition,and we didn't know why.,The oil gas started to spread,to people's feet,and everybody was nervous.,Meanwhile, Mr. To was watching the monitor,from a distance,,with a cigarette between his fingers.,It was really tense.,The cameraman knew,it was going to be a tough one,,because the fire would definitely,come close to him.,And we prepared safety measures for him,,drawing the thick smoke,by a big fan behind him,and reducing the heat with a hose.,He went wherever the fire went.,I was in charge of the explosion.,I wouldn't let others do it.,Sometimes, To would do it on his own,because he knew what he wanted.,I believe nowadays,,we can't find a team like that anymore.,People in the industry know that,I've worked with the same crew,for over ten years.,Their dedication,,passion and devotion,are way better and greater,than the movies themselves.,Thanks to the same experiences,,we don't need too many words,to communicate our approach.,During the past two decades or so,,I wouldn't have been be able to make,these movies without my team.,Here's today's paper.,Will it be a wasted effort again?,Well, if only this were tomorrow's paper,,then we could find out what happens.,Fly calling Centipede.,I think what matters most in filmmaking,is whether we can improve ourselves,each time.,I suggest we try and challenge ourselves.,Me, and the whole team,,because only after prolonged practice,can we truly make progress.,I said, how about a long take?,I had hoped to shoot for 10 minutes or so,but when we got hands on,,the difficulties appeared,bigger and bigger.,I said, he must make it in the first take,,no matter if the equipment works or not.,Because you can't shoot a second take,soon after the vehicles have exploded.,Since over 50 cars were involved,,with all the glass blown out,,rearranging it after the explosion,would take a week.,That's why he only got one single chance.,I remember it took us three days,for rehearsals.,The scene became a huge challenge...,and team work,was a vital element.,The whole scene was tense,,and required perfect cooperation.,Nobody was allowed,to make a single mistake.,Everyone should think clearly about,what to do and when,,and who's in charge of placing the props.,It's like we were all on a big stage.,I remember we did four or five rehearsals,that morning.,Everyone was too nervous to eat.,At mealtime, we were all like ""Come on.,Don't stop for a meal.,Shoot first, or we'll lose the momentum."",-Please don't give me a ticket.,-Okay.,-I'll let you off just this once. Go now.,-Thank you, sir.,What's in that bag?,I said, what's in that bag?,Hoi!,-We're in a gunfight. We need backup!,-Cricket, get over here and help us.,When the camera was pulled back,,the crew had to quickly remove the track,,lay mud, and set guideposts and so on.,There was only ten seconds,to let everyone go.,With the camera moving at that pace,,the grips, actors, and assistant directors,got tired of running along as well.,I had to watch the wireless monitor,during the gun fight,,and I had to press the buttons to explode,the vehicles following the camera,,as well as the reaction bombs,on the floor and wall.,This was the most difficult part,,not the camera part or acting,,which just required correct positioning.,Mr. To asked them all not to speak,but to listen to my orders.,Speak as little as possible,because the tension was so high,that talking would cause confusion,about whom to listen to.,And just do as they're told,,even if the guns don't work.,I was just watching the monitor,during the actual shooting,,but both of my hands,were inexplicably swollen after that.,My adrenalin rose due to the strain.,After that long take,,I felt that I should be more accurate,when giving instructions.,What I stick to is so important,that things could've turned out,very different had I made any concessions.,If I was afraid of difficulties,,some scenes would never have been seen.,HONG KONG MILKYWAY IMAGE,At that time, it was so hard,that I couldn't pay my staff.,But they were all waiting patiently.,Even without pay, they still worked for me,when other pictures needed them.,The market was very bad at that time.,We just relied on trust.,Because of the trust,,we would do it even without payment.,He worked with little rest in that period.,He slept in a cot in the company,at the most difficult time.,Sometimes, he couldn't manage,to wake up in the morning.,So I had to wake him up like,,""Director! Time to work."",He might spend the whole night,working on the script.,Those days might be,the hardest days of my life.,I couldn't afford the office rent,when things were at their worst.,To be frank, if I was out of work,for half a year, I could go bankrupt.,I had no idea how long it would be,until I had no movies to make,,or until I'd run out of energy.,I thought I wouldn't leave Hong Kong,no matter how tough it gets,,even though nobody was willing,to invest in movies.,Since the film market,had already collapsed,,and people no longer had confidence,in any film subjects,,why not do something in my flavor?,The Mission was made when,Milkyway Image was at its lowest point.,We were not able to help in films.,The only thing we could offer,was our clothes, and even our cars.,My car was badly damaged,during one shoot.,I remember chatting,with the cinematographer Siu-keung Cheng.,He said, ""I'm afraid,there's not enough film for editing. "",And I said, ""Really?,How much have we got?"",The film length of The Mission,is about 8500 feet,,while the whole length we'd shot,was less than 40,000 feet.,The ratio is about 1:4, which is very low.,In the following days,,I continued to work at Milkyway Image,I used to watch,how Mr. To did the editing.,Apart from the bad takes,,he really made full use of the film.,There was just enough,to make up a complete movie.,Having finished cutting The Mission,,we wanted to shoot for an extra day.,But we had no money.,I could only shoot,after the mall closed at 11:00 p.m.,and we had to leave,before six in the morning.,At that time, the budget wasn't enough.,I went scouting four hours in advance.,In that environment, I quickly,came up with the whole scene.,The inspiration was from a sense,of pressure, which was very important.,I like wide shots,and having many people in it.,There were several roles in that scene.,They enter the scene together.,They were an organic whole in the scene.,I don't want to miss,a single person in the picture,,unless they're standing at a distance,from each other.,I think close shots should be used less,in widescreen movies.,When there are less,,I need to know very clearly,what every shot's language expresses.,For example,,the characters' position in the mall.,What I concentrated on was how to match,the setting with the characters,and what kind of layout it would display.,I believe that, since he,started his career from television,and the space and effect,that a TV can accommodate is limited,,he would inevitably,or unconsciously,,try to rise above the limitations,of television,,one of which is the screen size.,After setting everyone's position,to compose a frame,,the hardest thing,is to figure out what's next.,And then what comes after that.,In my opinion, Hong Kong films,are not suitable for widescreen.,One reason is that our urban landscapes,are not so good. They're fairly narrow.,Another reason is that our actors' figures,are relatively small in Asia.,Johnnie To uses more people,to fill the widescreen,,in order to compensate for this inherent,weak spot of Hong Kong actors.,Sean, stay farther away, and back a bit.,Stay a little bit away from the camera.,No, that's too much.,-Sorry.,-You can always pay back my money.,-Sorry.,-But you can't break the rule.,I'm sorry.,I'm truly sorry.,I'll make an example of you!,No one will break my rule!,I think his primary concern is space,,especially the characters' position,in the space.,Because that indicates,their dramatic relationship.,In order to broaden the view,,his scenes are mostly set in the evening.,Because only in the evening,,will the whole street be vast and empty,and allow him to put a large number,of people in different locations.,When we were shooting The Mission,,I originally wanted to set a lighting,with a strong stage-effect in the mall,,but we failed,because we were short of money.,To achieve such an effect, we would need,a dozen 4k and 12k lights.,When we started to shoot PTU,,Director To wanted the lights,coming from up high,to put all the characters in the focus,,and achieve a sort of stage-like effect.,The biggest problem then was that,all the streetlights in Hong Kong,were a shade of yellow.,We wanted a different tone,,a white light with a hint of blue,by using HMI light.,We tried a lot of methods.,The production team spent,a lot of effort on it, too.,We often needed to borrow roofs,,trying one building after another.,When it failed,,we came up with another idea.,On the first afternoon,,we covered the streetlights,with black cloth,and hung the HMI lights one by one,on the light poles.,I think, in cities,,we can all vaguely see the surroundings,,but how they look,or how real they are isn't important,because I focus on people.,So the surroundings,would seem comparatively vague,,but you still roughly know what they are.,I don't want trivial things,in the background to dominate the frame.,I think the going upstairs scene in PTU,totally tests the imagination,of a director.,The scene was really created,""out of nothing."",There was nothing in there.,No script was needed.,But he created a scene,of strong suspense and intensity.,He made good use,of the heavy atmosphere among the cops.,They suspect the peril upstairs.,Plus, he took advantage,of the narrow space on the stairs.,The cops walk from a spacious street,into the limited space of narrow stairs.,The contrast of space,was also set out to bring the character,closer psychologically.,Because, initially, these characters,are at odds with each other.,In the script,,Simon Yam was supposed to go upstairs.,Originally, it was pretty simple.,Yam just went up,and we saw the torch light.,There were also some conversations.,But Mr. To cut them out,,so there is no talking.,There is no need for talk,because they are all clear,about the situation.,I remember that when we shot that movie,,the schedule was tight,and we were short of money,,so I had no choice but to shoot that scene,with the actors standing between two cars.,I put a lot of thought into that scene,and decided that the camera,would stand still for the whole scene.,I tried to capture,the characters' psychological activities,only by imagination.,I believed that these cops all have,a lot of doubts and questions.,If one emotionally enters,that dramatic world,,naturally, he will wait and see,whether they decide to go up or not.,I created this scene, basically,,from the perspective of script,,and then tried to render it,in film language.,How was this misinterpreted,in the first place?,As Sean said,,Milkyway Image, hard to imagine.,There is no completed script at all,,so how can one conjure any imagination?,You'll only get several pages of script.,This shooting style needs,actors with great energy.,As the title indicates,,Exiled was designed with a wish,to let people exile themselves a bit.,Actors need not care about the script,,and actually nobody needs to.,Just see what I could get in the end.,Though I had no script for The Mission,,I had the whole arrangement in my head.,But Exiled was shot with no fixed plan.,Whenever I'd go somewhere,and find the setting cool,,I'd get on with the production.,After it was done, I would do the next.,I just filmed along the way.,Don't ask me about my plan,because I had no idea either.,I just shot wherever I went.,Which way?,Which way?,You decide.,Just pick one!,I would shoot,whenever I'd have an idea.,If I went back home,,I'd just eat and sleep.,I wouldn't think about the movie.,Once I'd wrapped up the day's work,,I wouldn't keep thinking about it.,I'd only think about the production,on the set.,I really enjoyed those days.,-I can't even beat you like this.,-Of course. Damn!,I win.,When I was making Exiled,,I wished to enjoy the filmmaking world.,It's actually a little bit like,a game for fun.,In actuality,,the production atmosphere was pretty bad.,Because many colleagues,in the production crew,were very anxious,to know what the movie looked like,,and wanted to enter,the director's world or the screenplay.,But what we got was always just,the story outline or the scene outline,,which often got changed on site.,I remember when we shot Triangle,,the actors from mainland China,all came to ask me, ""Where's the script?"",I said, ""The script?,It is still being written."",They said, ""No way!,What shall we do then?"",A veteran actor asked me,,""What should we do? What shall we do next?,Still no script? No. What do we do?"",""What do we do? Everything will be okay,when we rehearse it."",I fully believe that,,through this way of filmmaking,,he would discover,what his film is trying to convey.,This is a shooting style,that proceeds along with life itself,,which is actually a very beautiful,experience, even if it entails hardship.,It is absolutely a process,that will bring vitality,and brilliance into a movie.,Mr. Wai said it well,,sometimes, we only have,the beginning part of a movie,,but as we shoot it, it will naturally,lead us to the following development.,You no longer control the movie,,the movie itself will lead a character,or an event to emerge.,Mr. Wai would sometimes say,,""It should play out like this.,But I haven't figured out,the previous transition yet."",We increasingly feel movies have life.,At the beginning,,we only had a very vague concept about it,,but now the feeling is getting stronger.,A movie will tell you that a certain role,should have a certain personality.,And the plot development,should be like this.,Some movies can be finished,in a short time, some take a long time,,and some even go,through many twists and turns.,But it's all right,,because each movie has its own life.,I think, unconsciously, this has become,a well-respected creative principle,for Milkyway Image.,Good morning.,Good morning.,Excuse me. Where's the toilet?,Excuse me. Where's the toilet?,Before Needing You,,we had never worked with Sammi Cheng.,Once we started collaborating,,we found that this actress,has her own rhythm for comedy,and her own interesting traits.,If you ask me how I guided Sammi,,I have never taught her acting at all.,Mr. Wai and I just captured,her... her strong suits,,and revised the screenplay accordingly.,They watched my performance on the set,and changed the screenplay accordingly,by adding or deleting some content,based on my performance,and my characteristics.,It's erased.,Consistent or not? Come on!,All right, the wheels are shaking.,No problem.,The first time I played a role,in Mr. To's movie, which was Needing You,,I felt he trusted in my performance,which really gave me confidence,to carry on acting.,I trust him and I like him.,All along, he has been clear,about what he wants.,He is really talented,in guiding an actor or actress,,whether he or she is good at acting,,to the direction that he needs.,When we were about to shoot the movie,,he would take out the screenplay,and re-digest it.,He's the kind of director,who doesn't make storyboards.,He would immediately draw it out,with the screenplay.,Because the schedule is tight,,very often, he would have made,the shooting script beforehand.,I remember the first time I saw Mr. To,shooting a movie. It was Fat Choi Spirit.,I felt I was watching a performance.,There were two or three cameras,on the set.,His arrangement,,the placement of the cameras,,the setting,,or the movement of the cameras.,It was like he was performing magic.,Mr. To had a scene-by-scene outline,and knew the sequence,and synopsis of each scene,,but wasn't clear about the changes,and details designed by the screenwriters.,I would assist him on the set.,He'd ask me if he had any questions.,After he talked to him--,This part isn't necessary.,Neither is this part.,It's set in Hong Kong.,-Let him talk towards the camera.,-Zero double three.,Draw a mark for Dave Wang,to find the correct position.,Nai-hoi Yau might be the one,who gained the most experience,from me and Mr. Wai.,He has gained,a lot of useful things,from our cooperation.,I also told Mr. Wai that I believe,Yau must be the future leader,of Milkyway Image.,If you can stay with Milkyway Image,and I think you have potential,,I will endeavor to help you improve.,Cut. One more time.,Also, don't throw your gun like that.,You were just tossing it.,With Milkyway Image, I have made...,two movies. One is Motorway,,and the other is Accident.,Both went over budget.,I am grateful to Mr. To. because,,imagine how many producers there are,who will allow you to take,such a long time to produce a movie?,Did the boss never press?,I don't think so.,Was it cheap?,It was at least 10 million dollars.,What about that?,Pressure is inevitable.,I was lucky because the boss,wouldn't directly push me.,Instead, he would ask Johnnie To,how much longer it would take.,Take Punished for example.,It wasn't a co-production and I knew,when I shot it that it would lose money.,Such a low-budget movie has no chance,of being shown in mainland China.,It could only be introduced there,as a foreign film,and the title had to be changed.,Wasn't he under pressure?,His pressure was how to cope,with the boss.,Even if there are directors like me,,it is him alone who holds up,the whole Milkyway Image,,rather than us.,We should let the younger generations,seek the future.,We should support them,to create their own film styles.,HONG KONG ARTS DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL,FIRST MEETING, 27 JAN 2011,Mr. Johnnie To.,There is no need to introduce him, right?,I am a director.,I have taken the office for two terms,,and this year will be the third term.,I hope I can go through this term,happily and peacefully.,There are three,government representatives.,I proposed the ""Fresh Wave"" program,on the first day I entered ADC.,Because when I went to schools,to attend some events,,there were always students,asking me how to enter,the film industry after graduation.,After several years,,I still got the same questions.,So I think that's a problem.,So I hope that colleagues,in the film industry,can give young people more opportunities.,In the next five to ten years,,we need to establish,a local Hong Kong culture,and a local Hong Kong film industry.,I would encourage people,not to think about co-production,with mainland China first,,but to do real Hong Kong movies.,But development of the film industry,needs support from the whole society.,Hong Kong cinema is not only an industry,,but also Hong Kong's postcard,and trademark.,I was talking with him yesterday,about how we can continue doing this work.,We never think it can be done,in one or two years.,We think it requires a long-term effort.,Because we are learning,about the changes in the world,and how to communicate with young people.,What I want to do,is unlikely to be accomplished,in just a few years.,We need at least a decade,to produce the initial results.,So I have made a significant promise.,If I can't really do it well,,I'd better not waste time.,This year is my last term,and I should have worked,on the program for nine years,when this term ends.,We are going to discuss detailed issues,in later sessions.,We will elect the committee members,and decide the personnel,in charge of certain fields.,If you are absent, it will be hard,for you to reverse the decisions made.,So you need to weigh them yourself.,Actually, there is no need for you,to attend the meeting today.,Yes.,But out of politeness,,I needed to introduce myself to everybody.,Often, nothing important can be achieved,in the first meeting.,But you have to be courteous,,so the head of ADC is here too.,It isn't difficult to have that idea,,what's difficult,is to really carry it out.,That's the hardest thing.,He is working on the program,of Fresh Wave, and other things.,He is willing to shoulder,this responsibility,to cultivate the younger generation,and also to pillar the company.,To be honest, I've heard people say,had he not taken on,so much responsibility,,his life would be much easier,and unfettered.,Why does he have to look after us?,Without us, he could focus on filmmaking,out there with much less burden.,I remember I went to Hong Kong once,right at the time of the award ceremony,of the ""Fresh Wave"" program.,He said, ""Come, Jia, do us a favor,and attend the ceremony."",Not long ago, I met him and he gladly said,that he was going to take some works,of young directors to Udine FEFF.,I think he is very happy,when he works with young people,or helps them.,I really admire him for that.,He isn't doing all this,for his public image, really.,As a director,who loves cinema and talent,,he enjoys helping these young people.,Please welcome Ms. Hau-yee Yan,,vice-chairman of ADC.,I will try my best to do the things,that I can do, such as Fresh Wave.,I'll keep working on it,for the rest of my life.,Thank you. Mr. To, please wait a minute.,Nick Cheung, you haven't said anything.,If you want me to say something, I will.,I don't know if it's okay to say that.,Come on!,I just said to him on the stage that,,Mr. To, other than making movies,,I haven't seen you care,about anything else so much.,I saw he was busy arranging things,everywhere today.,He is not young anymore,and it's really not easy.,So we really should thank him a lot!,When we first started,the Fresh Wave program,,people all thought poorly,of the younger generations in Hong Kong.,I, myself, also had doubts.,I was also discouraged,,until colleagues in ADC worked together,to promote the program.,And after two or three years,,there were indeed some achievements.,I might tell you,,even if ADC says,there are no funds for Fresh Wave,,I will try my best to raise money for it.,So please don't give up.,Just as Ms. Sylvia Chang said,,inevitably, there will be sacrifice.,But we will see,whether there is hope afterwards.,Although many have said that,Hong Kong movies are done for,,that Hong Kong movies,have lost their glory,,and some even say,Hong Kong movies are dead,,I still don't think so.,My opinion is, how can they possibly die?,Even if there's only one movie left,,Hong Kong movies still exist.,Besides, people in different times,have different experiences.,Although we lost the Great China market,,we still have the Hong Kong market,of seven million people.,It doesn't mean we can't make films,,or our younger generations,have lost the film industry.,It's not lost.,Hong Kong movies are still there.,But the problem is in what ways,the younger generations will make movies,,and how they can create,their own movie world.,I am against opportunistic filmmaking,,to be specific, movies like,Sex and Zen in 3D,,or some movies full of foul words.,I'm absolutely averse to it.,Movie shouldn't be used that way.,The movie culture and industry,shouldn't take this direction.,Hong Kong movies, even at their worst,,should not choose this road.,I respect people,who give really honest creations.,He's the one who comes from,a production background,and respects creation the most.,To be honest,,I have always told people,I am still learning how to make movies,because I still have a lot to work out.,Talking further about the artistic level,is really beyond my knowledge.,Because when I entered the industry,,I just wanted to find a job.,I'm not well-cultured in history,and literature.,I'm not one of those type of directors.,I am a director that's,good at handling situations.,It might have something to do,with the environment I grew up in.,So I was able to make PTU.,Just a uniform.,No need to buy other costumes.,No continuity problems for the actors.,I would think about,these practical issues first.,Besides, the worlds that I've created,in movies are not real.,For example, The Mission,,how can bodyguards carry guns,in the real Hong Kong?,I just imagine it,like a world of adventure.,I think it works too. I'm not saying,that I won't make such movies anymore,,but if I keep doing so, my movie world,will be really limited and narrow.,When I ask you questions,,answer, ""I understand completely."",I understand completely.,Thank you, Kun,,for choosing our bank's product.,She has chosen Wealth Co. Unit Trust.,Risk evaluation is high.,Your subscription,is one million Hong Kong dollars.,The bank will charge a two percent fee,,which is 20,000.,Why a fee?,I should think about,what a realistic world would be,,from the aspects of our real life,and literature.,I haven't engaged myself in that.,I started out making TV series for TVB,,most of which fall in the adventure genre,,or at least the action genre.,It's time for me to change,,say, to read more,,before I look back to the real world.,I should think about whether,I can find a different path here.,He is still pursuing and keeps learning.,I can tell his improvement,throughout these years. I mean it.,Go down.,I'm screwed.,I think one thing I didn't do well,in Life Without Principle,is I wasn't bold enough,to tell the story,without being too dramatic.,Though I kept trying to make,the whole story not that dramatic,,it didn't really work out in the end.,Faster!,Faster! Even a blind man,can be faster than you.,Alright. Okay.,Though I keep saying,I am learning filmmaking,,I still haven't figured it out completely.,Having been a filmmaker for many years,,I still haven't mastered the art.,Since I am still learning, why not pursue,a different route of filmmaking,,one which I really have,a clear understanding about?,When I first entered TVB,,I told myself I could forget,about pursuing a film career,if I couldn't make it,to assistant TV director in four years.,Surprisingly, I was promoted,to assistant director within two years.,So I aimed to be a TV director,in four years. I did it again.,The next dream was to make films,,and I set the same timeframe,,and surprisingly,,I did that two years later,with The Enigmatic Case.,It seems everything went smoothly.,However, it wasn't until my first film,that I realized that being a director,isn't the same as I imagined.,It's not simply working your way up,to that position as I did.,A director,must have a clear notion of film.,Don't set the other camera too far away.,That's why I always say these films,,from The Mission, PTU, Breaking News,,Exiled, to Sparrow,,they were all practice.,I try new ideas with each movie.,And discovered a whole new territory.,The 1997 Johnnie To was different,to what I later became,,because I hadn't really blazed,my own trail, creation-wise.,It seems everything is destiny.,I have to stay in Hong Kong,since I hadn't explored other areas.,Stay in a place like Hong Kong,,under this system,,and breed my own film career.,I remember something interesting.,During the screening of PTU in 2003,,we met the chairman of a film festival.,He really loved Hong Kong movies,and he had a profound,understanding of Hong Kong movies.,He said that the element,he was most delighted to see,wasn't the action,,but those scenes Director To shot,,such as the site of the gun fight scene,,and the China cafe.,He said, though To shoots action films,,these films can always present,an authentic Hong Kong,,and capture the essence of Hong Kong,,which he had never seen,from other filmmakers' movies.,Actually, China Cafe is the kind of tea,restaurant peculiar to Hong Kong.,It represents a certain,aspect of life in Hong Kong.,I feel that China Cafe is really,where we belong when we go there.,A place where we can talk comfortably.,Mr. To likes to show,the whole environment within one shot.,That environment alone,could tell the daily lives,of the cops in that film.,I remember watching one of To's films,,Election I or II, I'm not sure,,with my assistant cameraman,who grew up in Beijing.,I remember one scene,where they fought in a coffin store.,My assistant cameraman,grew up in Beijing,and had never been to Hong Kong.,He had never seen a coffin store,as only cremation is allowed in Beijing.,There are no coffin stores.,I believe by choosing such a unique space,,Mr. To totally caught the soul,of Hong Kong.,LOK HAU FOOK RESTAURANT,WELCOME,In these old areas, you live a close life,with passengers around.,You feel close with other people,even if you look down from upper stairs.,Even when all the shops are closed,,you can still tell their unique character.,What impressed me most,when I went to Hong Kong is its antiquity.,I had seen Hong Kong's pictures before,,when you arrive at Yau Ma Tei,,with shop signs in traditional Chinese,over your head.,Newspapers,are in traditional Chinese, too.,Especially with that picture of life,,it reminds me of how the late,Tsing Dynasty citizens looked.,When I talked about that,with Acheng later,,he said, ""Exactly!,The feeling of the late Tsing Dynasty!"",Because it hasn't been influenced,by the Republic of China.,Because it was ceded to Britain,in late Tsing,and became a colony,,without going through,the Republic of China,,or People's Republic of China phase.,To some extent,,I like the old architecture.,I think modern architecture,is kind of cold and distant.,It doesn't have any sense of humanity.,I always have my eyes on things,from the 1950s and 1960s.,At first, Sparrow was only about thieves.,But the demolishing of the Star Ferry Pier,really made me very sad.,Star Ferry, the pier with a history,of almost half a century,,will be relocated after,the last ferry leaves on Saturday.,The pier that has served Hong Kong,for almost half a century,will be shut down.,Star Ferry was put into use in 1958.,Protestors broke into the pier that was,to be demolished in the late afternoon.,They destroyed the lock,and broke into the pier.,Why push Hong Kong people like this?,Why does the government never take,ordinary people's lives into account?,Why don't they give us something,we really want in our daily lives?,It's fine to improve,the public transport in Hong Kong,,but was demolishing Star Ferry,the only solution?,I felt upset and sad at that time.,Filmmakers like us, are often attacked,when we stand out for our opinions.,Most people in the film industry today,,for the sake of survival,,or protecting ourselves from persecution,,choose to swallow our grudges.,This is totally different,from what we were like,before the return of Hong Kong.,I cannot condemn them,,as I am one of them.,To some extent,,we are not politicians at all,,just ordinary citizens.,However, I do think,we can express ourselves,,and one of the ways is through filmmaking.,We, filmmakers,,can use films as weapons,because films offer us,such kind of freedom and rights.,I often emphasize,that filmmakers are responsible,,for both the society,and the age we are living in.,I'm voting for Lok.,The background of Election,,is that elections were introduced,into Hong Kong,,or Hong Kong was at the critical point,of facing fake elections.,The society he depicted in Election,was also a political mode,with fake elections.,He used this to reflect reality.,From our perspective,,the most important things,we wanted to depict in Election,is that Hong Kong went through that era,and then entered 1997,,and settled in the era with,or actually without direct elections.,The most ironic thing is that...,even the triad societies,have a long history of elections,,why doesn't Hong Kong have that?,Election was made about ten years,after the return of Hong Kong,,I feel lots of things have changed.,Those changes are something,we never expected.,For example, I wouldn't have known,that Chun-ying Leung,would be the Chief Executive,in five years,,or Chee-hwa Tung would resign.,Lots of things in your daily life,have become uncertain,,which brings people to feel unsettled.,We have never felt settled.,825,HONG KONG 1 JULY MARCHES,CHUN-YING LEUNG,SHOULD STEP DOWN,That's bound to happen.,You totally go against the people.,The government never realized,it's only a service entity for the people.,The only value we should preserve is law.,The law should never be changed randomly,,or modified to meet,some individuals' interests.,This is the universal value.,Respecting democracy and law,are the foundations of a city.,These are the things, I believe,,that should never be challenged.,Otherwise people will lose their values,,which is most damaging of all.,So if there is only a bleak future,for Hong Kong ahead,,and people are deprived,of their basic rights of living,a peaceful life,,we will face some serious issues.,I want a mansion here.,A three-story one.,Second floor will have three rooms.,One room is for us.,One for a lawyer, and one for a doctor.,Our children will become,doctors or lawyers someday.,What do you say?,These two scenes send,the same message. His family.,Everything of his, including his career,,or even the whole era wasn't there then.,Everything starts from zero.,You can only see a vast field,,which could change drastically,once some movement or call arises.,These two fellas, Yong You and Louis Koo,,decided to set the whole rule,,starting from zero.,I do not intend to judge,the fair or foul of this government,,or that of this transition.,All I want to say is that human beings,could be crushed by the environment,in one second,,or to be more precise,,the environment we are in,decides our destiny more than ourselves.,We have another request.,From this day on,,the Baton will stay in your family.,What do you mean?,We respect the election system.,But when your term is up,,we don't want any little punks,like your Godfather,upsetting the social order.,You want to turn WoSing,into a family enterprise?,-Will my son inherit the Baton?,-We can trust you.,Your family will own WoSing.,You and I will work hand in hand.,No! My term expires in two years!,I'm just a businessman!,I don't want to be a gangster!,I don't want to be a gangster!,Forget about the logistic center!,Forget about my business in China!,It has been five or six years since,we finished Election II.,You can see that all the rich,are more or less similar,to the main character Jimmy.,They never dare to say no,to the central government.,He has some really poignant,and critical observations,that in the history of China,,or at least in its modern history,,the politics in China,is like a triad society.,This includes the mainland,,Hong Kong and Taiwan.,Definitely, China. Definitely, Taiwan.,Unfortunately, Hong Kong,has also entered the Triad politics era.,I am not sure,whether Hong Kong will develop into,what we talked about in Election II.,Thank you.,Thanks for your cooperation.,The return of Hong Kong in 1997,is a major historical event.,It was really a watershed for both,Hong Kong and mainland China.,How much did the seven million HK people,understand at that time?,I think, nothing.,But we do realize something,after all these years.,Probably, we could understand better,in ten more years.,You will never understand the process,until you really go through it.,This is era. What I'm saying is that,,we can never find the solution,for something,until we really experience it.,I do not dare to criticize too much,on current policies implemented,in Hong Kong by the Chinese government.,Because it absolutely has the right,to do anything it believes is right,as a sovereign and central government.,The problem here is, can't it govern,in a better, more balanced manner?,On the other hand, HK people,are partly responsible for this outcome.,We didn't seize the opportunities.,From my own perspective,,I do think that in the past years,,we HK people were not always,doing the right things.,Certainly, calling for democracy,and freedom is always the right thing.,I believe that as long as we are doing,our jobs at our best,,the future will come naturally.,For example, professionals like doctors,,nurses, and engineers,,they all have their own,professional capabilities.,Our capability is filmmaking,,so let's facilitate the development,of the society through filmmaking.,We should go.,We should go.,-You have over 400,000.,-The pool is 500,000.,One more game. Bet it all!,This is the decisive round!,Let's see your hand!,Stop! Thief!,Go after them!,The main character has lost everything.,He was gambling for the sake of gambling,,and he wanted to bankrupt himself.,He was so desperate.,But when he saw the woman,steal the money and run away,,that silly mettle made him feel,somehow his life was different.,So as I gave Louis Koo direction,for his running scene,,he might not have really understood.,Of course, plenty of people still don't.,I told him to laugh while running.,He didn't really understand,how he should laugh or why,,as a result, his acting didn't,clearly reflect that kind of feeling.,When we met after the film was finished,,we used to talk about this scene.,Mr. To wanted to show,a sense of liberation in this scene.,This character was under great pressure.,He had a potential problem,,but he wasn't willing to liberate himself.,He had no choice but to paralyze himself,by gambling and drinking.,When he saw Mona,,played by Cherrie Ying, running,,it was like the sun shining on him,,making him feel there was hope in life.,He laughed, not only because,of her running postures,,but because it reflected,a release of soul.,His life was enlightened with hope again.,Actually, there is another scene,with the same theme.,That is when Cherrie Ying, Aaron Kwok,and I ride on each other's shoulders,to chase after the red balloon.,Because that's the thing with eras.,I believe you've got to change yourself,with the times,,no matter what, but the world,and theory of film has never changed.,No.,You have to give him some more light.,If you block it out,,the reflection won't look good.,-Ready.,-Ready.

Halloween Kills (2021) - full transcript,"And the Halloween night when Michael Myers returned isn't over yet. Minutes after Laurie Strode (Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) left masked monster Michael Myers caged and burning in Laurie's basement, Laurie is rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, believing she finally killed her lifelong tormentor. But when Michael manages to free himself from Laurie's trap, his ritual bloodbath resumes. As Laurie fights her pain and prepares to defend herself against him, she inspires all of Haddonfield to rise up against their unstoppable monster. The Strode women join a group of other survivors of Michael's first rampage who decide to take matters into their own hands, forming a vigilante mob that sets out to hunt Michael down, once and for all.","Doctor, get back in the car!,No!

I mean, it's,bound to come out,at 500 pounds profit instead,of a thousand pounds.,Even so.,[SIGH],Have to spell it,out for some people.,Right, income down,to 1,000 pounds.,Now, half the strip,metal is 175 pounds.,Half the lubricant is 25 pounds.,Half the part-time,labor is 50 pounds.,Labor, well, that's three,lads at 100 pounds a week.,And why still three lads,with only half of 10 labor?,Well, you can't just take on and,lay off skilled lads like mine.,They'd be off to someone,else like a flash.,I have to guarantee,them their jobs.,You mean they're staff?,Well, I don't eat with,them, obviously, but yeah.,Yeah, staff, yes.,Three at 100 pounds is 300 pounds,,and overhead still 200 pounds.,Which makes total expenditure?,[MUMBLING],It is 750 pounds.,Ooh, very nice.,So 1,000 pounds take away,750 pounds is 500 pounds,Precisely.,What?,1,000 pounds take,away 750 pounds?,But I don't understand.,I'm doing half the business, but I've,only made here a quarter of the profit.,It must be some mistake.,Yes, there has been a mistake,,all right, but not there.,Look.,You worked out that 10,cases, 2,000 pounds of sales,,cost 1,000 pounds to produce and,sell, and left 1,000 pound profit.,Quite true.,But let's look at those costs.,200 pounds overhead,and marketing,,300 pounds for the,lads, that's 500 pounds.,And 500 pounds for,the rest, 100 pounds,for part time labor, 50,pounds for lubricants,and so on, and 350,pounds for metal.,But cut your turnover,by half to 1,000 pounds,,and see what happens.,Overheads don't change,,still 200 pounds.,Staff costs don't,change, still 300 pounds.,The other costs, metal, lubricants,,casual labor, they do change.,They come down from 500,pounds to 250 pound.,But it only leaves,you 250 pounds profit.,So that makes your cost per case,look just a little bit different.,If you're producing only five,cases a week instead of 10,,costs now take up 3/4 of the,price of each case, 150 pounds,,and profits are only,a quarter, 50 pounds.,But-- but-- but those are,just accountants' figures.,Ooh, certainly.,And bank managers' figures,,and receivers' figures,,and judges' figures.,Well, what is a decent,,honest chap supposed to do?,A decent, honest chap can start,by separating his fixed costs,from his variable costs.,Remember we compared,your forecast turnover,of 2,000 pounds with your,actual turnover of 1,000 pounds?,Well, take a look at that costs.,Some of them didn't change.,Staff and overhead were the,same whatever the turnover.,They are fixed costs.,The other costs only arose when,you produced cutlery metal,,and lubricants, and so on.,They are variable costs.,500 pounds on 10 cases,,250 pounds on five,,50 pounds a case.,So your variable costs,are 50 pounds a case.,Fascinating.,He is telling me that I make,150 pounds profit on each case.,That is not what,I'm telling you.,That is not what,he is telling me.,[CLEARS THROAT],What are you telling me?,I am telling you that,we are now in a position,to look for the missing figure.,What missing figure?,The key figure for any,new project, the one,figure you have to,know before you start.,- Which is?,- Which is-- what?,The break-even figure.,Look, you worked out that 10,cases gave you 1,000 profit.,Now what's the maximum,you can produce a week?,16, top whack.,But how many do you have to,sell just to stay in business?,Nine.,One? Five?,- I don't know.,- Oh.,Not yet. But now we're in,a position to work it out.,Now we know that each case has,a variable cost of 50 pounds.,And 150 pound profit.,- Not 150 pounds.,- Not?,How can it be profit if,you haven't paid the rent,,or paid the lads, or,paid your heating bills?,The fixed costs.,- Ah.,The 150 pounds that's left,after paying the variable costs,is a contribution towards,those fixed costs.,Once you've paid,those, then it's,a contribution towards profit.,At the moment, all,we know is that it's,150 pounds contribution.,It's the value you and your,lads have added to the metal,and so on that you bought,by turning it into cutlery.,Your fixed costs were,500 pounds, remember?,Well, you can think of them,as a hole 500 pounds deep.,Each case makes 150,pounds contribution,to filling that hole.,So two cases pay off 300,pounds of the fixed cost,,three pay off 450 pounds,,and with the fourth case,,you pay off the last 50 pounds,and make 100 pound profit.,If you make a fifth case,that week, then in that case,,as a 150 contribution, is,indeed profit, all of it.,In fact, your break-even in that example,is three and a third cases a week.,You see?,I knew it.,Typical.,Absolutely typical.,- I beg your pardon?,- Three and one third cases a week.,I was producing five.,I was making a profit.,I'm a success. Excuse me,,I must go and tell them.,- Wait a minute.,- What, what, what?,I said in that example.,There was something I,left out of that example.,Why?,Because there are some minds,that cannot take any more than,one idea at a time, if that.,What have we left out?,Depreciation of fixed assets.,Ah, of course.,You understand depreciation?,Obviously.,How would you describe it?,Uh, well, I'm not awfully,good at the describing lark.,But I'd be also interested,to know how you made out.,Thank you.,Tell me, how much,did you pay for all,of your machines, cutters,,dies, presses, and so on.,Uh, 20,000 pounds, the whole,of Aunt Agatha's legacy.,And how long until you,have to replace them?,- Ages. Ages.,- How long?,Oh, a good five years.,- And then you go out of business?,- No, then I buy some more.,- What with?,- Profits?,I suppose they're not enough.,I suppose you've spent,them on something else.,Oh, all right.,Tell me.,Right, depreciation.,You started with Aunt Agatha's,legacy, 20,000 pounds,,and you turned it,into machine tools.,But it was still,worth 20,000 pounds.,You just put it into,machines instead of the bank.,But as you use a,machine, you start,to use it up just as if you,were spending the money.,Each case of cutlery,takes a tiny bit,of the machine's value with,it, as well as the strip metal.,It's another cost of production.,And after five years,,the machine's whole value,will be gone.,You will have spent,the whole machine.,So part of your sales,income has to be,set against the invisible,expenditure of machine value.,And that's depreciation.,[COINS CLANKING],It may look like money in the,bank, but in five years' time,,you're going to need all of,it to replace your machines,and stay in business.,Using up 20,000,pounds over five years,means using up,4,000 pounds a year.,And you'll have to,allow another thousand,a year for rising prices because,those machines won't still,cost 20,000 pounds,in five years' time.,That means setting aside a total,of 100 a week for depreciation.,So that hole isn't,500 pounds deep.,It's 600 pounds,deep, which means,that 100 pounds,bit of contribution,from the fourth case,isn't profit after all.,It's swallowed by depreciation.,So your break-even is four,cases, not three and a third.,Their contribution has to,pay for 200 pounds overhead,,300 pounds labor, and,100 pounds depreciation.,600 pounds of fixed,costs, four contributions,of 150 pounds each.,So my break-even is four cases.,- So it seems.,Well then, what is all this,bankruptcy charade it [INAUDIBLE].,I was turning out five cases.,I'm laughing, aren't I?,Apparently not.,Uh, could there be,anything you've forgotten?,- No.,- Good.,Tell me how you started,this fascinating business.,Ah, what a story.,All my own idea.,Got a die maker, a prototype,,market tests redesigned,,wonderful publicity campaign.,Look at that.,Ads, mailshots, launched at a,buffet lunch served exclusively,with Carruthers Coupled Cutlery.,Triumph, triumph.,- When was all this?,Oh, uh, just over 12 months ago.,And how much did all these cost?,Well, you don't spoil a,ship for a ha'porth of tar.,Oh, no, no.,25,000 pounds.,And where did that come from?,No, it's perfectly alright.,I got a loan.,- Interest rate?,- 20%.,- Security?,- Machines, patents, trademarks.,- Repayable when?,- Just over 12 months.,And how much have been repaid?,Well, it's been a bit--,- Nothing?,- Sort of nothing.,- I see.,- What do you see?,I see why you aren't laughing.,Look, we said your,fixed costs were,200 pounds overhead, 300,pounds labor, and 100 pounds,depreciation, right?,Right.,But 20% interest on 25,000,pounds is 5,000 pounds a year.,That's a further,100 pounds a week.,Then there's the loan,itself, 25,000 pounds,to repay after a year.,That means setting,aside 500 pounds a week,for loan repayment, which,means your fixed costs aren't,600 pounds.,They're 1,200 pounds.,And how many 150 pounds,contributions is that?,Uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.,8 contributions.,So break-even is,eight cases a week.,And you are producing?,Five.,So you needed three,more just to break even,,four more if you wanted,to make any profit.,So what are you telling,me I should have done?,Produced a business plan,based on a break-even figure,worked out in advance.,You mean just as,you would have done?,Yes.,It's called marginal costing.,Actually, there is another way.,Total absorption costing.,Oh, please don't-- don't,confuse me with information.,It's simple, really.,Look, how much would it cost,you to produce one case a week?,Ah, I can do that.,1,200 pounds fixed,cost, 50 pounds,variable cost, 1,250 pounds.,And if you produce two cases?,What would they cost each?,Simple, half of that, which is--,What about the variable,costs on the second case?,Ah, as I was saying, half 1,300,pounds, which is 650 pounds.,- Three cases?,- Well, a third of 1,300 uh, 1,350.,And 3 into 13-- go 3 into--,- Four cases?,- It's four of-- what?,- Five cases?,- Well, hang on.,- Hang on, old chap.,- Just a second. Don't worry.,Notice, I've done it,all for you, look.,Five cases cost 290,pounds each to produce.,Six comes downs to 250.,Eight comes down,to 200 pounds each,,which is your break-even,figure, remember?,If you get up to,16, they're only,costing you 125 pounds each.,75 pounds contribution per case?,No, 75 pound profit.,That 125 pounds has absorbed,all your fixed costs already.,So it has.,75 pounds profit, good lord.,So if you want to use total,absorption costing instead,of marginal costing, you,can plot it like this.,No, it's a graph.,I don't believe in graphs.,Why not?,Well, I don't understand them.,Well, it's perfectly simple.,It says the same thing,in a different way.,Look, that is the,number of cases,you sell a week, taking 16,as the practical capacity,,and 4 to 16 as the,relevant range.,- Beg your pardon?,- Never mind, never mind.,That is the cost of,producing each case.,Production volume, production costs.,- Very clever.,But what does all that get you?,Well, suppose you reckon you,can sell 10 cases a week.,You just read up,the 10 line, and you,will see that each case will,cost you 170 pounds to produce.,So you've got to charge more than,170 pounds a case to make a profit.,If you charge less,,you're in the red.,Or you can do it the other way.,If you reckon that,200 pounds a case,is the most you can charge, just,read along the 200 pounds line,,and you will see you've got to produce,at least eight cases to break even.,Produce less, and,you're in the red.,But-- but if I had done,that and found it was eight,,this whole magnificent enterprise,would never have started.,I knew I couldn't guarantee,selling eight a week.,Yes, a business plan,does stop people,from starting up,doomed projects,,but it also gives you a chance,to look at alternatives.,- Could you have cut your variable costs?,- Nope.,- Used less labor?,- Nope.,- Charged more per case?,- Not a hope.,- Charged less per case?,- Oh, brilliant.,The man is a commercial genius,,business brain of the century.,You're going bankrupt,,you must cut your profits?,How many cases would you,sell at 150 pounds each?,- Oh, I'd sell a lot.,- How many?,15 a week at least.,- So?,- Hm?,What would 15 cost you each?,Well, how should I know?,But-- yes, but I've never,driven one of these.,That doesn't matter.,Nobody is looking.,But this thing can't,be working properly.,Why?,Well, it says 130 pounds.,I know.,But that's 20 pounds cont--,20 pounds profit per case.,Right.,- 15 cases?,- Right.,- 300 pounds profit a week?,- Right.,[LAUGHTER],- I'm rich.,- No, you're not.

She Devil (1957) - full transcript,"Doctor Dan Scott (Jack Kelly) invents a serum that cures illness and Kyra Zlus (Mari Blanchard), dying of tuberculosis, agrees to be a guinea pig. She becomes well and strong, but develops strange characteristics and a scheming personality. She kills Evelyn Kendall (Fay Baker) in order to marry her wealthy husband, Barton Kendall (John Archer) and later kills him to inherit his wealth. Dr. Scott and his associate, Dr. Richard Bach (Albert Dekker) decide that something drastic must be done and they trick her into having an operation.","(sinister music),(melodic jazz music),(tense music),Doctor Scott.,Oh, get out of here, Hannah.,Can't you see I'm busy?,But you've got to eat something.,Not now, later perhaps.,Oh, it's Dr. Bach!,What do you suppose,he's doing back so soon?,He probably missed your nagging.,
,
,
,Keep it.,Oh, Dr. Bach, we didn't,expect you for weeks.,I know, Hannah.,But I found European cooking,so vastly inferior to yours,,I had to hurry home.,Oh, Dr. Bach.,How's Dr. Scott?,I hope you took good care,of him while I was away?,Well, I didn't have much chance.,He's been cooped up in that,laboratory night and day.,Is this a laboratory, Dan, or a zoo?,Hello, Richard.,I thought you'd be sunning,yourself on the riviera,for several weeks yet.,
,
,
,Well, I had to cut my vacation short.,The hospital director's,cabled me to return,for a board meeting tomorrow.,The hospital is so overcrowded,they want to add a new wing at once.,You shouldn't let them,make such demands on you.,Just because you founded,Grand Mercy Hospital,,you shouldn't feel compelled,to take active charge.,After all you're supposed to be retired.,Well, you know how old doctors are.,Even when we retire,,we like to feel that we're still needed,,that we can still can perform,some service to humanity.,Now, is that why you,sponsored to my research,as a humanitarian gesture?,Not entirely.,I should also like to bask,in the reflected glory,of a young biochemist,,whose brilliance approaches genius.,Oh, really now.,Hannah, how many cocktails,has Dr. Bach had?,None yet, sir.,Oh, thank you.,Thanks.,It's strange, though, Richard.,I've got something here,that almost convinces me,I may be a genius.,Either that or suffering,hallucinations from overwork.,Really, what is it?,It's a new research I,mentioned before you left.,It's a project designed to prove,that the cure of any disease or injury,is essentially a process of adaptation.,Oh yes, you were,proceeding on the theory,that all living organisms,possess the ability,,in more or less degree,,to heal themselves.,By adapting themselves,to any harmful change,in their environment.,A lizard, for example,,will shed an injured tail,,grow a new one.,A chameleon will change its,colour for self-protection.,And you hope to develop a,cure all serum from insects,,since they are the most adaptive,of all living organisms?,Exactly.,So I have developed a serum,from the most highly evolved,and most adaptive of all,insects, the fruit fly.,It's the one insect,that is known to produce,a higher percentage of,mutants or changelings,than any other.,Look.,This looks like the same specimen,used by Professor Weismann,in his heredity experiments.,It is.,So I used fruit flies.,I putrefied the bodies, injected a cow,,and produced the serum.,After clarifying with albumin,,evaporating in vacuole and rectifying...,Never mind the technique now.,What were the results?,See for yourself.,These guinea pigs were tubercular,,yet the serum cured,them within three days.,[Richard] And so far no relapse?,[Dan] None so far.,Now here, a cat with a broken spine.,Well, that's astonishing.,Not the slightest trace,of spinal malformation.,This dog here was rabid.,(lip squeaks),Come on here, you, come on.,They were going to destroy him.,[Richard] Remarkable.,Look at this, Richard.,Now, this chimpanzee had double pneumonia.,As you know, that's almost always fatal,in the case of anthropoids.,Look at this one now.,[Richard] Well, I should say,,he had been most definitely cured.,And the zoo sent me this fella.,His throat was terribly lacerated,,and his intestine and,groin was badly torn.,Now, here's his picture when,I first received him.,But this shows a tawny-colored animal,,and this one is black.,Well, I assure you, it's the same one.,Oh, then the serum that,healed its lacerations,also changed its colour.,I'm not sure.,It could've been a natural process.,It's not unusual for some,leopards to grow a dark,or even completely black,fur as they grow older.,That's true.,(growls),This one seems unusually vicious.,Could it be that the,serum had some effect?,Oh, no.,No, he just doesn't like,to be experimented with,,after all he's not a guinea pig.,And now, Dan?,The next step is obviously,to test it on a human being.,Not on me, I trust.,No, nor myself.,We're both in good health.,I thought perhaps one of the,charity cases at the hospital.,Charity cases are not,experimental cases, Dan.,And that's what this,would be, an experiment.,I'm afraid I don't agree.,I may be old fashioned and conservative,,but somehow I feel there,is something unnatural,,perhaps even dangerous about this.,Well, how so?,The idea that this adaptive ability,can be captured and,distilled into a serum,,that a miraculous and,mysterious force of nature,can be bottled up, so to speak.,You've seen that it can be.,And you've seen the results.,So I have.,But you're not ready to,try it on a human being.,I believe I am.,Look, Richard, think of what,this might mean to medicine,if it is successful.,See here, Dan, I shouldn't,even offer this much,,it's against all medical ethics,,but let us leave it this way.,You continue testing your serum,with every conceivable,method of check and control.,And if I find someone, someone,whose case is hopeless,,absolutely hopeless, you understand,,and if the patient gives his consent,,then I will agree to let you try.,How can you find a case like that?,If the patient is conscious,,you think there's hope.,But if he isn't, how can he consent?,It's the best I can offer.,(melodic orchestral music),When was this patient admitted?,Three weeks ago today.,Tuberculosis, final stage.,We've tried everything to,stop the lung haemorrhages.,I thought you might suggest something.,Have you tried the Pilgrim technique?,It's too late for that, I'm afraid.,You can see for yourself.,She's been running 104,degrees now for the last week,,and then unable to take nourishment.,I better have a look at the patient.,Yes, doctor.,(coughing),Name: Kyra Zelas.,Age: 25.,Occupation: Unemployed.,Permanent address: None.,Parents: Dead.,Relatives or close friends: None.,Admitted by emergency call.,(coughs),Nurse, stethoscope.,(coughing),(breathing heavily),I gotta tell you.,I can't pay you for this.,Don't worry.,Just take it easy.,(coughs),I'm not gonna make it, am I?,Of course you are.,You're going to be all right.,(coughs),You're right.,It's too late to resort,to The Pilgrim technique.,Then it's hopeless.,Absolutely.,There is nothing that I can suggest.,Unless.,(soft music),(tense music),Ms. Sewell, get me Dr. Scott.,Ms. Zelas.,Ms. Zelas, can you hear what I am saying?,Yes.,I hear you.,Dr. Scott has developed a new serum.,It has never been tested on a human being.,It may not help you,,but I do not believe,it can do you any harm.,Would you be willing to submit yourself,to an injection of this serum?,Sure, why not.,What have I got to lose?,Good.,Then you will have to sign this release.,(coughs),(groans),(coughs),I'm gonna give her 10 cc's.,In her condition, any less,wouldn't be effective.,Point of injection?,Cubital.,It's all right.,How long before it'll take effect?,About six hours.,I'll call you.,(tense music),(buzzes),Yes?,[Secretary] Dr. Scott calling Dr. Bach.,(tense music),What's wrong?,She's not...,On the contrary, look at that.,Temperature's down to 99.8.,Incredible.,Almost normal.,I've never seen anything,like that, doctor.,Why, it's like a miracle.,What caused it?,One never knows about these,new antibiotic wonder drugs.,But I've never seen,them work so swiftly,,and in such a hopeless case.,Then perhaps it is a miracle.,I was sure the serum would save her life,,but I never dreamed,it would restore her to,normal health so quickly.,It's hard to believe.,Normal recovery would,ordinarily require months.,Then I'm gonna be all right?,I'm not gonna die?,- No.,- Hardly.,But we have a number of tests to take yet,and you still need the utmost care.,I already feel like a new person.,I can't remember ever in my life,feeling as well as I do at this moment.,Nevertheless, we can't take any chances.,Now, this is just to take,a blood specimen for study.,Ready now?,The needle will sting a little.,It's strange, the needle,doesn't penetrate completely.,Perhaps it's dull.,Oh there it is, it's fully inserted now.,She didn't even wince.,The needle mark, there's no sign of it.,The puncture has already closed.,Closed and healed instantaneously.,Does the light hurt your eyes, Kyra?,No, nothing can hurt me now.,Well, here's our prized patient.,When we found that you,were not in your room,,we thought maybe you'd gone for a walk.,I feel as though I could.,Shall I try?,Don't you dare.,What do you say, doctor?,Don't you think I'm,well enough to walk now?,The way the sun strikes you,,you look too ethereal to move at all.,Well, now, there's a scientific opinion,,if ever I heard one.,Good.,Very good.,Thank you, doctor.,She'll be here in a moment.,Those her release papers?,Mm-hmm.,Dan, I've been thinking.,We can't let her go back,to the sort of life that brought her here.,Besides I feel we should,keep her under observation,for a while.,You're still anticipating,some harmful after effects.,Not necessarily.,But for the time being,,I think she should be kept,under close observation.,With that, I agree.,(knocking on door),Come in.,Sit down.,Ms. Zelas, yours is the most unusual case,that Dr. Scott or I have ever encountered.,Naturally, we would like the opportunity,to continue further study.,Of course, whatever you say.,I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you.,Since Dr. Scott lives with me,,it occurred to us that you,might like to stay at my home,while we conduct certain additional tests,that we have in mind.,We understand that you,have no immediate family,or friends, or any job at present.,I'm afraid that's true.,Well, in that case, the,arrangements that I suggest,should solve your problems,and enable us to keep,you under observation.,Under observation, like a guinea pig?,Oh no, not at all.,Actually, I, well, that,is Dr. Bach and I have,grown very fond of you, Kyra.,We like you to consider,us as your friends.,I see.,We have plenty of room.,My housekeeper Hannah can chaperone you.,Now, what do you say?,What can I say?,After all you gentlemen gave me my life.,Or a new one.,Good.,Then it's settled.,I'd like to drive you home myself,,but I have a consultation shortly.,You can take a taxi.,Here is cab fare and here is my address.,I have phoned my,housekeeper to expect you.,Then you had it all arranged.,We felt sure you'd have,no objections.,And if I had?,That still wouldn't have made,any difference, would it?,Why do you say that?,Because all my life I've had to do,what other people wanted me,to do, no matter how I felt.,Well, if you don't wanna come with us...,Oh, I'll come, but,only because I want to.,From now on, I'm going,to do only what I want,and anything I want.,I'm gonna get everything,I can out of life.,Everything I've always wanted.,Well, that was quite an outburst.,I'm glad to see she has such spirit.,She was quiet and timid before.,You suppose it could be the serum,that had produced an emotional,as well as a physical change in her?,I wouldn't know about that.,As a biochemist, I don't,deal with the emotions.,As a brain specialist, I have to.,(car honks),(faint voices talking),(melodic music),[Woman] Can I have this, too?,Yes, you can have this, too.,What chance has a man got?,- I want that money.,- Huh?,(groans),(woman screams),(tense music),Call an ambulance.,Police, police!,Some girl robbed that man over there.,Struck him in the head,with a glass ashtray,and almost killed him!,She must be somewhere here in the store.,There's no other way out.,(tense music),What did this girl look like anyway?,She's a dark-haired girl,,wearing a cheap black dress.,(screams),I beg your pardon, madam.,(knocking on door),[Policeman] Who's in there?,(knocking on door),Open up, this is the police.,(door rattles),Come out of there or,we'll break the door down.,(door pounding),(knocking on door),Come out of there or,we'll break the door down.,Open up, this is the police.,What is it?,Oh, pardon us, miss, but,we were looking for a girl.,I mean, for a black-haired girl.,A thousand apologies, miss.,It's perfectly all right.,(knocking on door),(faint voices talking),Miss, oh miss?,Good evening, sir, Dr. Scott.,- Hannah.,- Good evening, Hannah.,How is our new house guest?,I hope you're taking good care of her.,That's funny.,You said she was sick and,would need looking after, but...,But what?,Well, she doesn't look very sick to me.,And she seems mighty able to,take care of her own self.,Certainly is pretty, though.,I'm glad you think so.,You mind telling her we're here?,That won't be necessary, Hannah.,(sultry music),Well, young lady, this is a surprise.,It's wonderful.,What have you done to yourself?,Washed my face and bought,a new dress, that's all.,But your hair.,I went to a beauty parlour.,I wanted as much change from,my old self as possible.,And quite a change it is!,Do you like it?,It's beautiful.,Like nothing I've ever seen before.,Well, this calls for cocktails.,- Hannah?,- I'm way ahead of you, doctor.,I've already mixed a batch,of martinis extra dry.,Good, come.,Sick.,Oh, thank you, Hannah.,Thank you.,Well, uh, here's to my experiment.,And to its continuing success.,Thank you.,I just can't get over,how wonderful you look.,It's such a beautiful dress.,Wait 'till you see the rest of them.,And the lingerie, ooh la la.,You've acquired a wardrobe?,Yes, I needed a few things.,A few things?,Hal.,Why not show them to us?,Of course, I'd love to.,My, my, young lady, did,you run into a millionaire,on your way here?,You're the millionaire, doctor.,Tam?,I used your name as reference,to open an account at Bronson's.,Well, I must say, you've,shown wonderful taste.,I hope you don't mind,what I've done, Dr. Bach.,I'm sure I'll able to pay,you back some way soon.,But I just had to begin my new life,with some of the beautiful,things I've always dreamed of.,Of course, we understand, Kyra.,There's anything else you might need,,I'd only be too glad to...,You're sweet.,But you've done enough for me already.,You certainly accomplished a great deal,in the short time you had this afternoon.,I should've thought that,beauty parlour alone,would've taken up most of your time.,Your hair is simply beautiful.,Fascinates me.,Yes, it fascinates me too.,I think we better let Kyra,rest a while before dinner.,I want to check something,with you in the laboratory.,Well, if we must, we must.,See you at dinner, Kyra.,How am I ever going to,thank you wonderful men,for everything?,By keeping well and beautiful.,I don't know what's come over you, Dan.,You're behaving like a,lovesick boy over that girl.,That's ridiculous.,I'm only trying to make the,poor girl feel she's wanted.,What'd you bring me down here for?,I wanna take a look at something.,What the devil is it?,Hair from that poor girl's head.,What is this, a joke?,It may very well be on us.,I've never seen such natural lustre.,I don't believe that hair,was bleached or dyed.,I'll know in a minute.,Hmm, just as I thought.,See for yourself.,There isn't a slightest,trace of chemicals or dye.,You're right.,That pigmentation is undoubtedly natural.,I may have overlooked something.,May be the change in,that leopard's coloration,was not a natural process,that I first supposed,,but some effect of the serum.,If so, then it could've been the serum,that changed Kyra's hair.,Probably so.,But in that case, why was,she so evasive about it?,Don't ask me why women are so evasive,about the colour of their hair.,They are, that's all I know.,That emotional outburst,when she left the hospital,,emotional disturbances cause,glandular disturbances,,they in turn produce physical changes.,Maybe it wasn't the serum,alone that changed her hair,,but the serum and some,great emotional disturbance.,(melodic music),(tense music),(paper rustles),Good morning, Hannah.,Good morning, Richard.,- I wouldn't say that.,- Take a look at this.,Well, what about it?,Do you recognise that dress?,That's Kyra's.,The girl who wore,that dress slugged a man,and stole $700 from him.,The clothes and the charge account.,Exactly.,I never believed that,story and neither did you.,That's where she got the,money for those clothes.,But how did she get away with it?,Despite of a thorough search,,the police were unable to,find the black-haired girl,who assaulted the man.,Hours later, her dress,was discovered discarded,in a dressing room.,That explains it.,It was a dark-haired girl,that committed the crime,,and a blonde that left the store.,And you think that under,the stress of the situation,and her fear of being discovered that,she actually willed that,metamorphosis on herself?,Definitely.,And that explains the natural,pigmentation of her hair.,But if she can change her appearance,,the serum must've stimulated,her adaptive powers,to a fantastic degree.,Psst.,(sultry music),Good morning.,Good morning, Kyra.,What a lovely day.,That's your dress, isn't it?,Of course it's mine.,I left it there on purpose.,I never wanted to see it again.,It's only a reminder of my past existence.,Did you hit that man,and steal his money?,It says here, a,black-haired woman did that.,That's what you were when,you went to that store.,When that woman struck the man,,I saw my chance to get all,the things I've always wanted.,So I picked up the money he dropped.,And in the excitement, nobody,noticed what I'd done.,Why don't you stop lying to us, Kyra?,You never dyed your hair.,What do you mean?,We tested some strands of,your hair in the lab last night,,and it is not dyed.,The pigmentation is natural.,Oh, so you've been spying on me.,Kyra, we're not blaming,you entirely for what you did.,You probably didn't have complete,control of your impulses.,Are you trying to say I'm insane?,No, no, it's just that the treatment,may have unbalanced your,glandular functions temporarily.,Never mind that scientific double talk.,I did what I wanted to do,and I'm gonna keep right on doing it.,And I'd like to see you stop me.,You had no right experimenting with me.,You knew what you were doing.,Well, you created me, and,I'm your responsibility.,(tense music),It's beyond me.,Perhaps the serum produced a mental,as well as physical transformation.,It may have developed a devilish cunning,with her new appearance.,Do you think there's a possibility,the effects of the serum may wear off,and that she may eventually,change back to her former self?,I don't know.,I don't think so.,But is there the possibility,that you could develop,a counteracting drug,,something that would dissipate,the effects of the serum?,It's possible, I suppose.,Why?,Don't you see?,I am suggesting that you,try to develop an antidote,to the serum, as a precaution,,to be used only if we both agree,that there is a need for it.,I suppose you're right.,(growls),I hope I'm not interrupting,anything important.,No, no, it's just another experiment.,I overheard Dr. Bach and you.,I know what you're doing.,It's just a precautionary measure.,In case you do find this antidote,,what makes you think I'll,let you try it on me?,Do you think I'll let you change me back,to what I used to be?,No, never.,Nothing can harm me now.,I'm immune to anything.,Afraid of nothing.,(hard thud),- (growls),- Kyra, be careful!,(growls),It's nothing.,(perplexed music),You like me the way I am, don't you?,You know I do.,(melodic music),(tube breaks),(lively classical music),Enjoying yourself?,Oh, indeed I am.,I'm improving my mind.,I never had much time for,art, music, and literature.,Now I'm making up for lost time,among your cultural treasures.,Oh, that's fine.,And you'll have an opportunity,to display your newly acquired knowledge,at our little party tomorrow night.,I know.,I can hardly wait to meet,all those wonderfully interesting people,,I understand are coming.,Interesting, I don't know.,Rich, yes.,The bigger the bank roll,,the bigger the bore.,The good doctor here will,suffer through almost anything,in order to raise money for his clinic.,(graceful music),No, thanks.,This is quite a party,you have arranged, doctor.,Is this the way you,spend the clinic money?,No, Henry, this is on me.,You have all been so wonderfully generous,with your contributions.,I feel that I must reciprocate.,What I wanna know is where,is this beautiful house guest,I hear you're hiding out?,Ms. Zelas will be down in a few moments.,Oh, I thought you were married,to your test tubes, Dr. Scott?,My husband's clinical interest,is running true to form.,Oh, Evelyn, you know we never quarrel,until after our third drink.,Scott, that's the most beautiful,test tube I've ever seen!,You look lovely, my dear.,I would like you to meet, Ms. Kyra Zelas,,a patient of mine.,She has been a very sick girl.,No one would believe it.,I am Barton Kendall, Ms. Zelas.,Yes, Mr. Kendall, I've heard of you.,And this is the Mrs. Kendall, Kyra.,How do you do?,So nice to know you, Ms. Zelas.,What lovely hair.,Thank you.,Doctor, dinner is served.,Thank you, Hannah.,Ladies and gentlemen, we can eat.,I don't know what the,seating arrangements are,,but I'm taking Ms. Zelas.,- Mrs. Kendall.,- Thank you.,(melodic piano music),Where is she?,Where is Kendall?,Frankly, affairs like this bore me.,But you, you're a,delightful surprise, Kyra.,Are you really as rich as,the magazines say you are?,(chuckles) Richer.,You know, you haven't told,me anything about yourself.,Haven't you guessed?,Dr. Bach and Dr. Scott,simply materialised me,out of a test tube.,Of course.,I should've known that,anybody as lovely as you,couldn't possibly be human.,Aren't you being a little indiscreet?,Naturally, I make a career of it.,Even when your wife is watching?,Evelyn's a very practical,and a very understanding woman.,So, naturally, she's inclined,to overlook little things like this.,Please, you mustn't.,Barton, I'd like you to,take me home at once, please.,Why, nonsense.,We just got here.,You insist on creating a scene?,I'm not creating one, you are.,I'm not necking with this trollop.,What did you say, Mrs. Kendall?,Oh shut up!,(slaps),I won't tolerate it any longer.,The brazen way you,carried on with that girl,,I have never been so humiliated.,[Barton] Then why,don't give me a divorce?,I've asked for it often enough.,Divorce.,You don't want a divorce, not really.,You might have to,marry one of these women,you get involved with.,Perhaps I shall.,Oh, now surely you're not,serious about this girl.,You've only just met her.,You know nothing about her.,I know all I need to know.,Look, Evelyn, our marriage,hasn't worked out, and won't.,So why go on with it?,Doesn't it occur to you that I,might still be in love with you?,It isn't me you care about.,It's the power and the,prestige of the Kendall name,that you don't wanna give up.,Very well.,If that's what you choose to believe,,then I won't give it up ever.,(tense music),(sinister music),Who are you?,Don't you recognise me, Mrs. Kendall?,No, I don't think so.,Good, then there no one else will.,What do you mean?,Just few moments ago,,you slapped me, remember?,It's you.,You shouldn't have,done that, Mrs. Kendall.,No, no!,No!,(screams),Evelyn, where are you?,Who the devil was that?,Evelyn!,(tense music),Let's move her inside.,Careful.,Sorry, Kendall, death by strangulation.,But why, who?,Must've been that woman,we saw running away.,But what reason could she have had?,Who could she have been?,Well, one thing's certain.,It was a woman with black hair.,Mrs. Kendall must've,struggled, grabbed her.,Poor Mrs. Kendall.,I caught a glimpse of,a woman from my window.,A dark-haired woman,running across the lawn.,We'd better call the police.,We've searched the grounds,and covered everything we can,for the time being.,I guess I can rely on you, doctor,,to see that whoever was here,tonight will be at the inquest.,I accept full responsibility.,Thank you.,Night.,Night.,Now that we're alone,,I'd like to ask you a few questions.,- Must you, doctor?,- I'm very tired.,Tell us once more about,the dark-haired woman,,the one that you saw from the window.,I've told you all I know.,Are you sure the woman had black hair?,Well, aren't you?,You found a handful of her hair.,I think that woman was you.,Oh, ridiculous!,No more ridiculous than the incident,of the black-haired,girl in the dress shop.,I think you killed Mrs. Kendall.,All right, I killed her.,She slapped me and I killed her.,And I'll kill anything,that stands in my way,and there's nothing you can do about it.,You're just as much,involved in this as I am.,And now, I'm very tired.,Good night.,She's right.,There's nothing we can do.,What about the antidote?,I...,I haven't made much,progress with that as yet.,Maybe you haven't tried hard enough.,Maybe you've become so,infatuated with her.,Are you implying that I protect her,because I've fallen in love with her?,You wouldn't be the first man,to fall in love with his own creation.,Richard, that's nonsense.,It's sheer nonsense.,All right, I won't argue the matter.,But surely you realise we,can't let her go on this way.,Then what would you suggest?,We know the serum affected,her glandular system,and stimulated her natural adaptive powers,to an unbelievable degree.,We know too that the most,effective agent for adaptation,is the human brain and the neuro system,,once believed to be controlled,by the pineal gland.,But that gland has no known functions.,Not to our knowledge.,But in ancient times, medical men believed,that the pineal gland,did control the brain.,More than that, they thought,it was the centre of the soul.,And you suspect what?,That the serum contains the,long sought hormone, pinealon.,And if it does, it may well,have affected that gland.,You mean by hypertrophy of the pineal?,Exactly.,If hypertrophy resulted,,the pineal gland would've,been so over stimulated,,as to produce a demon, a devil,,a creature with warped soul.,Do you suppose this hypertrophy,could be corrected through surgery,,that it might bring her back to normal?,I am reasonably certain it can.,You could perform the,operation in the lab.,But what about the anaesthetic?,We'd have to take her by,surprise to administer it.,We'll use ethyl chloride.,It's almost instantaneous.,We can give it to her in her sleep.,(sinister music),What you are trying to do?,How dare you attempt such a thing!,Kyra, please, let me explain.,- We're only trying to help you.,- Help me!,You don't wanna help me,,you wanna destroy me.,You can't.,Nothing can!,Now get out before I destroy you.,(clatters),(humming),Good Morning, Hannah.,Good morning, Dr. Bach.,Good Morning, Dr. Scott.,Isn't it a lovely morning?,What's lovely about it?,It's Ms. Zelas.,What about Ms. Kyra?,She's gone, bag and baggage.,Cleaned out every stitch

On the Buses (1971) - full transcript,"Stan gets a little annoyed when his Mum and Sister keep buying expensive items on hire purchase, but the money he earns for overtime working as a bus driver means that he can afford it... just! His job is secure, as bus drivers are hard to come by, and his overtime prospects are good, until the bus company decide to revoke a long standing rule and employ women bus drivers. Aghast at the thought of no overtime and, therefore, less wages, he joins forces with his long time work colleague Jack to sabotage the new female employees.","- Hello, darling.,- Hello.

now,We're here for you, man.,We're at the studio,,don't disappear on us.,It means,that poverty is a new slavery.,It means that the new Jim Crow,is an intense form of slavery.,It means that working people,locked into a declining economy,in which wages stagnate,,prices escalate,,and profits go, hit the top,,is also a form of slavery,,metaphorically and,literally speaking.,Now, climate change for me,,is a very serious issue.,I don't think it's going,to be the catalytic issue.,I think it's either going to,be revolutionary transformation,that allows us to,get some control,over banks and corporations,,so we can treat nature as a,""thou"" rather than an ""it,"",but when I hear a lot of,discourse on climate change,,I hear people,thinking, ""Oh my God,,my life is going to,be like a wasteland."",Well, you know, for poor people,,it's a wasteland everyday.,How y'all doing?,I'm Will, and uh...,I want to share a poem,by a good friend of mine,,Jan Barry, he served in Vietnam.,How big would the,War Memorial wall be,if it listed all the names of,soldiers who died of suicide?,Abel Baker Charlie,,Jacob David George, three,tours in Afghanistan,,Jeffrey Lucey.,I dunno how long, looking,out the glass door at this car,,'cause I was convinced,that somebody was coming,,maybe not for me specifically,,but like they, they,picked my house,and they were coming,into my fucking house.,I'm crouched in my kitchen at,two a.m. holding a handgun,,'cause there's a car,parked across the street.,Like what the fuck am I doing?,I wasn't in my body.,I was...,I don't know where I was.,Did they?,Really?,fuck kinda,organization is that?,- Well...,- Yeah.,Okay,What were the numbers?,Operation Truth,,you remember that?,- Well, I'm gonna go back in...,- Alright...,- Need a hand?,-

grown...,Like opium, hashish,and all that...,This really wild beach, where you had to,wade across this lagoon, to get to it...,...climb around on these hills,,and there were these caves...,...find these like,porcelain boxes...,on what look like,dragon-claw feet,and when you open it up,inside was a human skeleton...,What's up?,Hey, how's it going?,You're here for the workshop?,- Yeah.,- Right

cool,,even MP's are all right here.,Which state were you in?,Confusion.,The idea is that we,make handmade paper,from military uniforms.,We want vets to,tell their own story,in their own words and

ours.,These guys are binding,a book right now,,all by hand,and right here, we're just,cutting some rag.,So this is where the whole,thing begins, basically.,Hey guys, the cops are here.,I'm just

Afghanistan.,Nate was in Iraq back,during the invasion,,that's around the,time I was there too.,Um, you got your own uniforms?,I do, I didn't,bring them though.,That's cool, that's what,these are here donated for,,so really it's a pretty,straight forward process.,We cut this stuff up and it,goes in the machine in there,,it beats it to a pulp and then,we form sheets on screens,,press them, dry 'em and then,it's up to you, a blank slate.,So yeah, we give,you the toolbox,,it's up to you to decide,what you want to do with it.,We're just going to help,you along the way, so..,You know, just to

your head.,That shit works?,I don't know.,I guess it kinda does!,it's better than nothing, but...,So sometimes,what we'll do,is we'll cut the uniform,off the veteran's body.,So like the first,guy who did it,,he cut it from his own body,and then I had him and another,friend cut it off my body,as this sort of rite of passage.,Okinawa's a,pretty trippy place,even without LSD.,So I remember,going, in high school,,going the guidance,counselors office.,""What do you want to,do after you graduate?"",So I wrote on there,,I wanna go to college,and work with computers,and I spelled college,and computers wrong.,I was never really,good at spelling.,I'm better now, but,the guy pivots in his,chair, within arm's reach,is a whole rack of,recruiting pamphlets.,He grabs the US Army with,the Apache helicopter,right on the top.,Up against the car and I,said, I'm here for the party.,I'm here for the party,because I genuinely thought,that I was at the right house.,I thought I was there,for, for a party,and he said, I,don't know that guy.,They cuffed me, stuffed me,,took me to the county jail.,Wrong fucking house.,Felony criminal trespass,,public intoxication,,do 90 days in jail,,then after that go to the,military, I get a clean record.,My life was going this,direction and very suddenly,,it turned and went,this direction,,like I stepped into an,alternative reality or something.,So how are you,holding up, man?,I'm good man, thanks.,You sleeping?,Yeah, me neither.,So, you've been in touch,with his family yet, or what?,Yeah man, I uh,,called his mom.,I didn't know what the fuck,to
